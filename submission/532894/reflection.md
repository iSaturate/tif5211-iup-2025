I'm calvin and this is my short reflection on this special topics project.

At first, I genuinely had no idea how smart contracts work and at first I only know MetaMask as some weird
cryptocurrency wallet to buy and sell crypto (believe it or not, I used to for some reason have MetaMask on 
my old PC, never used it though). But during this assignment, I learnt how the smart contracts work and how to deploy a smart contract.

Smart contracts are really interesting now that I look at it. It's kind of cool I can just basically input a hash
(or probably crypto trading in real life scenario) Have it notarized and then sort of "cross-check" whether or not
a hash is true or false. Now I also know that doing these transactions requires gas fees as well.

I think I am able to grasp a bit more on how blockchain technology works. It's also really cool to see that
Anyone can basically see if my contract is verified on Etherscan. It's transparent basically, just like what
Most people describing crypto like bitcoin is "transparent". I used to just "know" that fact without
diving too deep into it, but now it feels like I could understand even just a little bit more about how these
blockchain technology works. (Even though I think this is still definitely scratching the surface).
